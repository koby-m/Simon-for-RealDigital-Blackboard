**Description:**            
A remake of the Simon game where the player repeats back an increasingly complex pattern indicated via
flashing lights. On-board buttons control the game, with score and messages shown on the on-board
seven-segment display.
Has three toggleable features: 
- Only-newest mode: Does not repeat the entire pattern back, only the latest addition
- Color mode: Will utilize the RGB LEDs to play back the pattern
- Debug mode: Will make the pattern only consist of one number
